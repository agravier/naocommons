LIVE555 Streaming Media
</H1>

This code forms a set of C++ libraries for multimedia streaming, using open standard
protocols (RTP/RTCP, RTSP, SIP).
These libraries - which can be compiled for
Unix (including Linux and Mac OS X),
Windows,
and QNX (and other POSIX-compliant systems)
- can be used to build streaming applications.
The libraries are already being used to implement applications
such as the
"<a HREF="../mediaServer/">LIVE555 Media Server</a>"
and
"<a HREF="../proxyServer/">LIVE555 Proxy Server</a>"
(RTSP server applications),
"<a HREF="../liveCaster/">liveCaster</a>"
and
"<a HREF="../multikit/playRTPMPEG.html">playRTPMPEG</a>"
(for streaming MP3 audio using RTP/RTCP),
and
"<a HREF="../vobStreamer/">vobStreamer</a>"
(for streaming DVD content using RTP/RTCP/RTSP).
The libraries can also be used to stream, receive, and process MPEG,
H.264, H.263+, DV or JPEG video,
and several audio codecs.
They can easily be extended to support additional (audio and/or video) codecs,
and can also be used to build basic
<a HREF="../openRTSP/">RTSP</a>
or
<a HREF="../playSIP/">SIP</a>
clients and servers,
and have been used to add streaming support to existing media player
applications, such as
"<a HREF="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a>"
and
"<a HREF="../mplayer/">MPlayer</a>". 
(For some specific examples of how these libraries can be used, see
the <strong><a HREF="#testProgs">test programs</a></strong> below.)

<h4>Source code</h4>
The project source code is available
- as a ".tar.gz" file -
<a HREF="./public/">here</a>.
See <a HREF="./#config-unix">below</a> for instructions on how to build it.

<h4>Mailing list</h4>
<a name="mailing-list"></a>
There is a 
<a HREF="http://www.live555.com/liveMedia/faq.html#mailing-list-address">developers' mailing list</a>: "live-devel@lists.live555.com".
Users (or prospective users) of the libraries are encouraged to <a HREF="http://lists.live555.com/mailman/listinfo/live-devel/">join</a> this
(low-volume) mailing list, and/or to review the
mailing list's
<a HREF="http://lists.live555.com/pipermail/live-devel/">archives</a>.

<p>
Are you planning to implement RTP
(and/or RTSP or SIP)?
Instead of writing your own implementation from scratch,
consider using these libraries.
They have already been used in many real-world RTP-based applications,
and are well-suited for use within embedded systems.
The code includes an implementation of RTCP, and can
easily be extended (via subclassing) to support new RTP
payload types.

<h2>Description</h2> 

The code includes the following libraries, each with its own subdirectory:

<p><hr><p>
<h3>UsageEnvironment</h3>
The "<a HREF="./doxygen/html/classUsageEnvironment.html">UsageEnvironment</a>"
and
"<a HREF="./doxygen/html/classTaskScheduler.html">TaskScheduler</a>" classes
are used for scheduling deferred events,
for assigning handlers for asynchronous read events,
and for outputting error/warning messages.
Also, the "<a HREF="./doxygen/html/classHashTable.html">HashTable</a>" class
defines the interface to a generic hash table,
used by the rest of the code.
<p>
These are all abstract base classes;
they must be subclassed for use in an
implementation.
These subclasses can exploit the particular properties of
the environment in which the program will run
- e.g., its GUI and/or scripting environment.

<p><hr><p>
<h3>groupsock</h3>
The classes in this library encapsulate network interfaces
and sockets.
In particular, the "<a HREF="./doxygen/html/classGroupsock.html">Groupsock</a>" class
encapsulates
a socket for sending
(and/or receiving) multicast datagrams.

<p><hr><p>
<h3>liveMedia</h3>
This library defines a class hierarchy
- rooted in the "<a HREF="./doxygen/html/classMedium.html">Medium</a>" class -
for a variety of streaming media types and codecs.

<p><hr><p>
<h3>BasicUsageEnvironment</h3>
This library defines
<a HREF="./doxygen/html/classBasicUsageEnvironment.html">one concrete implementation</a>
(i.e., subclasses)
of the "UsageEnvironment" classes,
for use in simple, console applications.
Read events and delayed operations
are handled using a select() loop.

<p><hr><p>
<a name="testProgs"></a><h3>testProgs</h3>
This directory implements some simple programs
that use "BasicUsageEnvironment" to demonstrate how 
to develop applications using these libraries.

<h4><strong>RTSP client</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>testRTSPClient</strong>
is a command-line program that shows you how to open and receive media streams that are specified
by a RTSP URL - i.e., an URL that begins with
<em>rtsp://</em>
<p>
In this demonstration application, nothing is done with the received audio/video data.
You could, however, use and adapt this code in your own application to (for example) decode and play the received data.
<li><strong><a HREF="../openRTSP/">openRTSP</a></strong>
is similar to "testRTSPClient", but has many more features.
It is a command-line program that - unlike "testRTSPClient" - is intended to be used as a complete, full-featured application
(rather than having its code used within other applications).
For more information about "openRTSP" - including its many command-line options - see
<a HREF="../openRTSP/">the online documentation</a>.
</ul>

<h4><strong>RTSP server</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>testOnDemandRTSPServer</strong>
creates a RTSP server that can stream, via RTP unicast,
from various types of media file, on demand.
(Supported media types include:
MPEG-1 or 2 audio or video (elementary stream),
including MP3 audio;
MPEG-4 video (elementary stream);
H.264 video (elementary stream);
MPEG Program or Transport streams, including VOB files;
DV video;
AMR audio;
WAV (PCM) audio.)
The server can also stream from a
<a HREF="http://matroska.org/">Matroska</a>
or
<a HREF="http://www.webmproject.org/">WebM</a>
file
(by demultiplexing and streaming the tracks within the file).
MPEG Transport Streams can also be streamed over raw UDP, if requested
- e.g., by a set-top box.
<small>
      <ul>
      <li>This server application also demonstrates how to deliver - via RTSP - a MPEG Transport Stream that arrived at the server
      as a UDP (raw-UDP or RTP/UDP) multicast or unicast stream.  In particular, it is set up, by default, to accept input from the 
      "testMPEG2TransportStreamer" demo application.
      </ul>
</small>
</ul>

<h4><strong>SIP client</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong><a HREF="../playSIP/">playSIP</a></strong>
is a command-line program
(similar to "openRTSP")
that makes a call to a SIP session (using a
<em>sip:</em> URL),
and then (optionally)
records the incoming media stream into a file.
</ul>

<h4><strong>MP3 audio</strong> test programs</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>testMP3Streamer</strong> repeatedly reads from a MP3 audio file
(named "test.mp3"), and streams it, using RTP, to the multicast group
239.255.42.42, port 6666
(with RTCP using port 6667).
This program also has an (optional) built-in RTSP server.

<li><strong>testMP3Receiver</strong> does the reverse: It reads a MP3/RTP stream
(from the same multicast group/port), and outputs the reconstituted
MP3 stream to "stdout".
It also sends RTCP Reception Reports.
<small>
      <ul>
      <li>Alternatively, the MP3/RTP stream could be played using 
  one of <a HREF="../liveCaster/receiving.html">these tools</a>.
      </ul>
</small>
</ul>

<h4><strong>MPEG video</strong> test programs</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>testMPEG1or2VideoStreamer</strong> repeatedly reads from a
MPEG-1 or 2 video file
(named "test.mpg"), and streams it, using RTP, to the multicast group
239.255.42.42, port 8888
(with RTCP using port 8889).
This program also has an (optional) built-in RTSP server.
<small>
<ul>
<li>By default, the input file is assumed to be a MPEG Video Elementary Stream.
If, however, it is a MPEG Program Stream, then you can also insert a
demultiplexing filter to extract the Video Elementary Stream.
(See "testMPEG1or2VideoStreamer.cpp" for details.)
<li>Apple's "<a HREF="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">QuickTime Player</a>" can be used to receive and view this streamed video
(provided that it's MPEG-1, not MPEG-2).
To use this, have QuickTime Player open the file "testMPEG1or2Video.sdp".
(If "testMPEG1or2VideoStreamer's" RTSP server has been enabled, then
QuickTime Player can also play the stream using a "rtsp://" URL.) 
<li>The Open Source
"<a HREF="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a>"
and
"<a HREF="../mplayer/">MPlayer</a>" media players
can also be used. 
<li>RealNetworks' "<a HREF="http://www.real.com/">RealPlayer</a>"
can also be used to play the stream.  (A recent version is recommended.)
</ul>
</small>

<li><strong>testMPEG1or2VideoReceiver</strong> 
does the reverse: It reads a MPEG Video/RTP stream
(from the same multicast group/port), and outputs the reconstituted
MPEG video (elementary) stream to "stdout".
It also sends RTCP Reception Reports.

<li><strong>testMPEG4VideoStreamer</strong> repeatedly reads from a MPEG-4
Elementary Stream video file (named "test.m4e"), and streams it using RTP
multicast.
This program also has a built-in RTSP server.
<small>
<ul>
<li>Apple's "<a HREF="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">QuickTime Player</a>"
can be used to receive and play this audio stream.
To use this, have the player open the session's "rtsp://" URL
(which the program prints out as it starts streaming).
<li>The Open Source
"<a HREF="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a>"
and
"<a HREF="../mplayer/">MPlayer</a>" media players
can also be used. 
</ul>
</small>

<li><strong>testH264VideoStreamer</strong> repeatedly reads from a H.264
Elementary Stream video file (named "test.264"), and streams it using RTP
multicast.
This program also has a built-in RTSP server.
<small>
<ul>
<li>Apple's "<a HREF="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">QuickTime Player</a>"
can be used to receive and play this audio stream.
To use this, have the player open the session's "rtsp://" URL
(which the program prints out as it starts streaming).
<li>The Open Source
"<a HREF="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a>"
and
"<a HREF="../mplayer/">MPlayer</a>" media players
can also be used. 
</ul>
</small>
</ul>

<h4><strong>MPEG audio+video (Program Stream)</strong> test programs</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>testMPEG1or2AudioVideoStreamer</strong>
reads a MPEG-1 or 2 Program Stream file
(named "test.mpg"), extracts from this an audio and a video
Elementary Stream, and streams these, using RTP, to the multicast
group
239.255.42.42, port 6666/6667 (for the audio stream)
and 8888/8889 (for the video stream).
This program also has an (optional) built-in RTSP server.
<small>
<ul>
<li>Apple's "<a HREF="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">QuickTime Player</a>" can be used to receive and view this streamed video
(provided that it's MPEG-1, not MPEG-2).
To use this, have QuickTime Player open the file "testMPEG1or2AudioVideo.sdp".
(If "testMPEG1or2VideoStreamer's" RTSP server has been enabled, then
QuickTime Player can also play the stream using a "rtsp://" URL.) 
<li>The Open Source
"<a HREF="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a>"
and
"<a HREF="../mplayer/">MPlayer</a>" media players
can also be used. 
<!--
<li>RealNetworks' "<a HREF="http://www.real.com/">RealPlayer</a>"
can also be used to play the stream.  (A recent version is recommended.)
-->
</ul>
</small>
<li><strong>testMPEG1or2Splitter</strong>
reads a MPEG-1 or 2 Program Stream file
(named "in.mpg"), and extracts from this an audio and a video
Elementary Stream.  These two Elementary Streams are written into files named
"out_audio.mpg" and "out_video.mpg" respectively.
</ul>

<h4><strong>MPEG audio+video (Transport Stream)</strong> test programs</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>testMPEG2TransportStreamer</strong>
reads a MPEG Transport Stream file
(named "test.ts"), and streams it, using RTP, to the multicast
group
239.255.42.42, port 1234 (with RTCP using port 1235).
This program also has an (optional) built-in RTSP server.
<small>
<ul>
<li>The Open Source
"<a HREF="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a>"
media player
can be used to play this stream.
<!--
<li>RealNetworks' "<a HREF="http://www.real.com/">RealPlayer</a>"
can also be used to play the stream.  (A recent version is recommended.)
-->
</ul>
</small>
<li><strong>testMPEG2TransportReceiver</strong> 
does the reverse: It reads a MPEG Transport/RTP stream
(from the same multicast group/port), and outputs the reconstituted
MPEG Transport Stream stream to "stdout".
It also sends RTCP Reception Reports.

<li><strong>testMPEG1or2ProgramToTransportStream</strong>
reads a MPEG-1 or 2 Program Stream file
(named "in.mpg"), and converts it to an equivalent
MPEG Transport Stream file,
named "out.ts".
<li><strong>testH264VideoToTransportStream</strong>
reads a H.264 Video Elementary Stream file
(named "in.264"), and converts it to an equivalent
MPEG Transport Stream file,
named "out.ts".
</ul>

<h4><strong>PCM audio</strong> test programs</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>testWAVAudioStreamer</strong> reads from a WAV-format audio
file (named "test.wav"), and streams the enclosed PCM audio stream via
IP multicast, using a built-in RTSP server.
<small>
<ul>
<li>The program supports 8 or 16-bit PCM streams, mono or stereo, at any
sampling frequency.
<li>Apple's "<a HREF="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">QuickTime Player</a>"
can be used to receive and play this audio stream.
To use this, have the player open the session's "rtsp://" URL
(which the program prints out as it starts streaming).
<li>Optionally, 16-bit PCM streams can be converted to 8-bit u-law format
prior to streaming.
(See "testWAVAudioStreamer.cpp" for instructions on how to do this.) 
<li>The Open Source
"<a HREF="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a>"
and
"<a HREF="../mplayer/">MPlayer</a>" media players
can also be used. 
</ul>
</small>
</ul>

<h4><strong>AMR audio</strong> test programs</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>testAMRAudioStreamer</strong> reads from a AMR-format audio
file (named "test.amr") - as defined in RFC 3267, section 5 - and streams
the enclosed audio stream via IP multicast, using a built-in RTSP server.
<small>
<ul>
<li>Apple's "<a HREF="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">QuickTime Player</a>"
can be used to receive and play this audio stream.
<!--
provided that you have also installed the
<a HREF="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/3gpp/">QuickTime 3GPP component</a>.
-->
To use this, have the player open the session's "rtsp://" URL
(which the program prints out as it starts streaming).
</ul>
</small>
</ul>

<h4><strong>DV video</strong> test program</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>testDVVideoStreamer</strong> reads from a DV video
file (named "test.dv"), and streams it
via IP multicast, using a built-in RTSP server.
<small>
<ul>
<li>At present, we know of no widely-available media player client that can
play this stream.
</small>
</ul>
</ul>

<h4><strong>VOB (DVD)</strong> streaming test program</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong><a HREF="../vobStreamer/">vobStreamer</a></strong>
reads one or more ".vob" files (e.g., from a DVD),
extracts the audio and video streams,
and transmits them using RTP multicast.
</ul>

<h4>Support for server 'trick play' operations on MPEG Transport Stream files</h4>
<ul>
<li>The applications
<a HREF="./transport-stream-trick-play.html">
<strong>MPEG2TransportStreamIndexer</strong>
and
<strong>testMPEG2TransportStreamTrickPlay</strong>
</a>
</ul>

<!--
<h4><strong>Darwin Streaming Server injection</strong> test programs</h4>
These test programs
use the liveMedia
"<a HREF="./doxygen/html/classDarwinInjector.html">DarwinInjector</a>" class to
stream audio and/or video into a remote Apple
"<a HREF="http://developer.apple.com/darwin/projects/streaming/">Darwin Streaming Server</a>"
(aka. "<a HREF="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/products/qtss/">QuickTime Streaming Server</a>"),
for playing by (potentially multiple) RTSP clients.
In other words, these applications, rather than having their own built-in
RTSP server (like most of the applications noted earlier), use a separate RTSP server (a Darwin Streaming Server) to serve clients.
(Note that these programs require that you have write access to the
Darwin Streaming Server.)
<ul>
<li><strong>testMPEG1or2AudioVideoToDarwin</strong>
repeatedly reads a MPEG-1 or 2 Program Stream file
(named "test.mpg"), extracts from this an audio and a video
Elementary Stream, and streams these, using RTP, to 
a specified Darwin Streaming Server,
using the session name "test.sdp".
<li><strong>testMPEG4VideoToDarwin</strong> repeatedly reads from a MPEG-4
Elementary Stream video file (named "test.m4e"), and streams it, using RTP, to
a specified Darwin Streaming Server,
using the session name "test.sdp".
</ul>
-->

<h4><strong>Miscellaneous</strong> test programs</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>testRelay</strong> repeatedly reads from a UDP multicast socket,
and retransmits ('relays')
each packet's payload to a new (multicast or unicast) address and port.
<li><strong>testReplicator</strong> is similar to <strong>testRelay</strong>,
except that it replicates the input stream
- using the "FrameReplicator" class -
and retransmits one replica stream to another (multicast or unicast) address and port,
while writing the other replica stream to a file.
<li><strong>sapWatch</strong> reads and prints SDP/SAP announcements
made on the default SDP/SAP directory (224.2.127.254/9875)
</ul>

<p><hr><p>
<a name="WindowsAudioInputDevice"></a><h3>WindowsAudioInputDevice</h3>
This is an implementation of the "liveMedia" library's
"AudioInputDevice" abstract class.
This can be used by a Windows application to read PCM audio samples from
an input device.
<p>
<small>
(This project builds two libraries:
"libWindowsAudioInputDevice_mixer.lib",
which uses Windows' built-in mixer, and
"libWindowsAudioInputDevice_noMixer.lib", which doesn't.)

<h2>How to configure and build the code on Unix
<small>(including Linux, Mac OS X, QNX,
and other Posix-compliant systems)</small>
</h2>
The source code package can be found
(as a ".tar.gz" file)
<a HREF="./public/">here</a>.
Use "tar -x" and "gunzip" (or "tar -xz", if available)
to extract the package; then cd to the "live" directory.
Then run
<pre>
    ./genMakefiles &lt;os-platform&gt;
</pre>
where <em>&lt;os-platform&gt;</em> is your target platform
- e.g., "linux" or "solaris" - 
defined by a "config.<em>&lt;os-platform&gt;</em>" file.
This will generate a Makefile in the "live" directory
and each subdirectory.
Then run "make".
<ul>
<li>If the "make" fails, you may need to make small modifications to the
appropriate
"config.<em>&lt;os-platform&gt;</em>" file,
and then re-run "genMakefiles <em>&lt;os-platform&gt;</em>".
(E.g., you may need to add another
"-I<em>&lt;dir&gt;</em>" flag to the
COMPILE_OPTS definition.)

<li>Some people (in particular, FreeBSD users)
have reported that the
<a HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU version of "make"</a>
- often called "gmake" - 
works better than their default, pre-installed version of "make".
(In particular, you should try using "gmake" if you encounter linking problems with the "ar" command.)

<li><strong>If you're using "gcc" version 3.0 or greater:</strong>
You may also wish to
add the <em>-Wno-deprecated</em> flag to CPLUSPLUS_FLAGS.

<li>If no "config.<em>&lt;os-platform&gt;</em>" file exists for
your target platform,
then try using one of the existing files as a template.
</ul>

There's no official 'install' procedure; you can put the 
"live/" directory wherever you wish
- but you must leave the directory structure intact.
You may wish to do the following:
<pre>
    rm -rf /usr/local/lib/live ; cp -r live /usr/local/lib
</pre>
Alternatively, you could copy just the library binary files.

<p><IMG  WIDTH="531" HEIGHT="6" SRC="../graphics/separator.gif" alt="-----"><p>
<a name="config-windows"></a>
<h2>How to configure and build the code on Windows</h2>
<ol>
<li>Unpack and extract the '.tar.gz' file
(using an application such as "WinZip").
<li>If the 'tools' directory on your Windows machine is something
<em>other than</em> "c:\Program Files\DevStudio\Vc", change the "TOOLS32 =" line in the file
"win32config".
<li>In a command shell, 'cd' to the "live" directory, and run
<pre>
    genWindowsMakefiles
</pre>
</ol>
This will generate - in each subdirectory - a "*.mak" makefile
suitable for use by (e.g.) Microsoft Visual Studio.
<p>
<small>
<ul>
<li>Alternatively, if you're starting from a Unix machine, you can generate the Windows
Makefiles by running
<pre>
    ./genWindowsMakefiles
</pre>
(after - if necessary - changing the "TOOLS32 =" line in the file "win32config", as noted above).
Then, copy the "live" directories and its subdirectories (in ASCII mode) to a Windows machine.
<li>To use these Makefiles from within Visual Studio, use the "Open Workspace"
menu command, then (in the file selection dialog)
for "Files of type", choose "Makefiles (.mak)".
Visual Studio should then prompt you, asking if you want to use this 
Makefile to set up a new project.
Say "OK".
<li>Note that you will need to build each of the
"UsageEnvironment",
"groupsock",
"liveMedia",
and
"BasicUsageEnvironment"
projects <em>first</em>,
before building
"testProgs".
<li>If you wish, you can build the
"WindowsAudioInputDevice" project also.
<li>Doug Kosovic notes:
<small>
Visual C++ 2003 no longer comes with the old I/O Streams headers
iostreams.h et al, or the corresponding library msvcirt.lib. So anybody
trying to build the LIVE555 code with VC++ 2003 might find the
following useful:
A non-sourcecode modification workaround for VC++ 2003 is to copy the
missing headers and msvcirt.lib from VC++ 2002. In file 'win32config'
add an extra -I switch to COMPILE_OPTS to find the old headers and a
-LIBPATH: switch to LINK_OPTS_0 to find msvcirt.lib.

<a name="todo"></a>
<h2>To do...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Extend the "liveMedia" library to support even
more media types and/or codecs.
<li>Supply additional "UsageEnvironment" subclassed implementations
- e.g., for use with scripted environments, such as Tcl, Python, or Perl.
<li>Expand the RTCP implementation to support more SDES items (other than just CNAME), and to more completely handle incoming RTCP packets.
<li>In places the code uses data types such as "unsigned", where
instead specific lengths (e.g., 32 bits) are required.  The data types should
be changed in each such case.
<li>Fix the "groupsock" implementation so that it could use IPv6 instead
of IPv4.
(At present, 4-byte addresses are hard-wired into the code in several places.)
<li>Switch to using ISO-conformant C++ headers
(but in such a way that the
code can remain portable across both Unix (using gcc) and Windows
(using Visual C++)).
<li>Implement network sockets ("groupsock"s) as "liveMedia" 'sources'.
This will make the code for RTP sources more consistent with the rest of the
"liveMedia" library, allowing them to be "FramedFilters".
(This will make it possible to use synthetic network sockets - e.g., for
debugging or simulation.)
<li>Add support for SRTP ('secure' RTP), and perhaps also RTSP-over-TLS.
<!--
<li>Improve "ByteStreamFileSource" so that it uses "iostream"s.
This will allow readers to use iostream operations (such as "<<").
-->
</ul>
